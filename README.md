# python_raymarcher
A Ray Marcher rendering engine built in Python.

Very much still in development. The plan is for this to eventually be able to render complex scenes with relative speed, and include a set of basic shaders so it can produce a decent looking image out of the box. However it will be extensible with support for shader modules. 

### raymarch.py
The main rendering engine. Defines shapes and renders the scene.

### shapes.py
Contains classes for various primitives.

### tools.py
Contains various classes and functions to make working with the 3d space easier.
